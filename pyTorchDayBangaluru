Deploying massive Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models is primarily constrained by memory bandwidth and KV-cache fragmentation. This session presents an optimized inference pipeline integrating vLLM’s PagedAttention and continuous batching with the native hardware acceleration of the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture. We will demonstrate the implementation of native NVFP4 quantization on Blackwell Tensor Cores, analyzing how 4-bit floating-point precision on Blackwell mitigates memory bandwidth bottlenecks to accelerate tensor execution and maximize token throughput for sparse architectures.

## 🎯 **6. Questions You Can Ask the Audience / Stakeholders**

Asking thoughtful questions shows depth and opens dialog.

### **Technical Engagement Questions**

✔ “How many of you have run into memory bandwidth limits in production models?”

## 🧪 **7. Confidence Boosters: Be Prepared With**

#### *Example Benchmarks*

Even simple numbers make talks stronger:

* Throughput gains (e.g., “2× faster with NVFP4”)
* Memory reduction percentages

#### *Mini Diagrams / Comparisons*

Make visual contrasts:

1. Normal attention vs paged attention
2. Standard batching vs continuous batching
3. FP16 vs NVFP4 memory footprint

---

## 📌 **8. Phrases That Show Depth**

Use confident language like:

* “This optimization directly addresses memory bandwidth — the true bottleneck.”
* “Quantizing to NVFP4 improves cache utilization without severe accuracy loss.”
* “Continuous batching maintains high GPU utilization over irregular workloads.”

## 🧠 **9. Common Pitfalls — What NOT to Say**

❌ Avoid vague claims like “this is faster” without context
❌ Don’t misrepresent quantization as always lossless
❌ Avoid over‑claiming results without specifying hardware
