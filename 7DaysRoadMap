vLLM Codebase Roadmap: 7-Day Plan
🔹 Day 1: Orientation & High-Level Flow

Goals:

Understand what vLLM does at a systems level

Run a demo locally and trace high-level architecture

Tasks:

Clone the repo: https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm

Read README.md and try basic generation (CLI or API)

Skim these files:

vllm/engine/llm_engine.py

vllm/entrypoints/api_server.py

Draw your own block diagram: input → batching → decode → output

🔹 Day 2: Engine & Model Interface

Goals:

Learn how models are loaded and used for prefill/decode

Understand LLMEngine, ModelExecutor, and their orchestration

Focus Files:

vllm/engine/llm_engine.py

vllm/engine/model_executor.py

vllm/model_executor/* (esp. layers.py, sampling_metadata.py)

🔹 Day 3: Scheduler — Core Logic

Goals:

Understand continuous batching and scheduling heuristics

Focus Files:

vllm/scheduler/scheduler.py

vllm/scheduler/policy.py

vllm/scheduler/worker.py

Key concepts: request queuing, prioritization, GPU assignment

🔹 Day 4: KV Cache & Paging System

Goals:

Dive into vLLM’s paged KV cache implementation

Focus Files:

vllm/kv_cache/*

Understand:

PagedAttention

Cache block allocation and reuse

cache_block.py, kv_cache.py

Optional but valuable:

Explore vLLM’s use of FlashAttention/paged attention mechanisms

🔹 Day 5: Decoding, Sampling & Performance

Goals:

Understand how token decoding works

Learn how sampling, logits, and CUDA are managed

Focus Files:

vllm/model_executor/layers.py

vllm/sampling_params.py

Token loop inside llm_engine.py

🔹 Day 6: API Server & External Interface

Goals:

Understand how the API server exposes the engine

Focus Files:

vllm/entrypoints/api_server.py

vllm/engine/generation.py

Understand response formats, queue flow

Try:

Customize an API response or add latency logging

🔹 Day 7: End-to-End Trace + Contribution Ready

Goals:

Pick one inference request

Trace it through: Input → Scheduler → Decode → Return

Tasks:

Add print/debug logs

Read CONTRIBUTING.md

Pick a good first issue or performance task to try
